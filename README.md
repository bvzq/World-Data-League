# World-Data-League

World Data League is a competition to solve social oriented problems through statistical solutions. It was divided in four stages, different subject each:

 - Stage 1: Public Transport
 - Stage 2: Traffic in cities
 - Stage 3: Cycling in citites
 - Stage 4: Air Pollution

Every delivered repository was scored by a jury following different criteria, such as, Technical Skills, Business and Soft Skills among others. Only the top 10 teams (50 starting teams) go to the Finals. Me and my team (BelManuel Soto) achieved that goal, so the last repository to deliver was about:

 - Finals: Noise Pollution

For the 4 firsts stages every team had 2 weeks to make a repository, for the finals only 60h. Finally BelManuel Soto team finished 6th.

In this folder I publish all our work during these 3 months.
I hope you like!
